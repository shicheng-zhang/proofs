Proof No 1:

Let a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 2

  a ^ 2

Under conditions that a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 2

we have equation of forming sq, where 4 equal triangles form a square, with hypotenuse forming center square. 
center square = c ^ 2
outside larger square = (a + b) ^ 2 or a ^ 2 + 2ab + b ^ 2

However:
    
Since Total area of larger sq = (a + b) ^ 2
the four triangles each are 4 * (.5 * a * b)
    = 2ab
But the total area of the triangle is (a + b) ^ 2 
And it is also equal to the c ^ 2 square plus the 4 triangles
So it would surmise that:
    c ^ 2 + 2ab = a ^ 2 + 2ab + b ^ 2
    remove 2ab from each side

Then final eq --> c ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2

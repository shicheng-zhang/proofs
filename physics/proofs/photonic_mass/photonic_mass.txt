We can deduce the fact that black holes do not have infinite mass:

M (black hole) ~= M (main seq star resulting in black hole)

Therefore:
    Fg (black hole) != Infinite

but since g == GMR^-2
    R is infinitessimally small for astronomical standards

Therefore g, although not infinite, is a absurdly large value.



Photons do not experience massive refraction from large amounts of electromagnetic radiation:
    Eg: No electron curviature around magnetars

Therefore:
    Photon movement is entirely dependent on the mass of the photon.

    Deduction --> c != infinite

But: Photons are massless
    Fa == ma 
    Fg == mg 

if m == 0, then (Fa || Fg) == 0
    Therefore --> If photon mass == 0, Fa (black hole) == 0, no change in motion will occur.

But --> light bends around a black hole:
    If under deduction that photons do not experience severe deviations from electromagnetic radiation:
    Fg --> influence on photons
    And since Fg has influence on photons --> Fnet (gravity black hole) != 0
    And thus --> Mass (photon) != 0
